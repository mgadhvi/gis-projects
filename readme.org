#+title: QGIS Projects

This portfolio showcases a collection of GIS projects I have created using QGIS from the [[https://spatialthoughts.com/courses/introduction-to-qgis/][Spatial Thoughts QGIS Course]]

Each project demonstrates various geospatial analysis techniques and visualization methods, highlighting my skills in handling spatial data, creating maps, and performing spatial analysis. Explore the projects to see how GIS can be applied to solve real-world problems and gain insights from geographic data.

*** Project 1: 10 Largest Earthquakes
For this project, I created a visualisation of the 10 Largest Earthquakes recorded between 2000 and 2002.

This project focused on creating a visualisation using multiple layers. I looked at applying symbology in a way to make information clear. The final print layout used labels and design elements to make the may attractive and easy to understand

Data was obtained from:
- /Earthquakes/: National Centers for Environmental Information. The significant Earthquake Database
- /Faults/: GEM Global Active Faults Database (GEM GAF-DB)
- /Land/: Natural Earth Data

*** Project 2: New York City Population Density Heat-map

This project focused on creating a spatial join between a spatial and non-spatial dataset. This allowed me to create a data source that showed the population of NYC Boroughs along with vector polygons of their location. This project emphasised the importance of Data Normalisation techniques such as calculating density, rate and percentage to ensure data is presented accurately. This is especially important when creating a choropleth map.

Data was obtained from:
- New York City OpenData Portal

*** Project 3: Geo-referencing and Geo-processing Bangalore Lakes

This was a 2 part project that dealt with investing the lost of lakes and water bodies in Bangalore, India. We started with a map image of the City of Bangalore from 1925 and used various Geo-referencing techniques to super impose it onto a modern Open Street Map of the city. This allowed us to see the changes that had taken place over time.

From this, we were able to create multi polygons to represent the lakes around the city and categorise them based on whether they still exist, are partially lost or completely lost.

Data was obtained from:
- Open Street Maps
- Wikipedia (Historic Map)

*** Project 4: Bangalore Rail Access

For this project, I investigated what percentage of people in Bangalore had access to its metro network. To build the base layers, I used Open Street Map to query where the metro stations were using the QuickOSM plugin. The next task was to create a 1km perimeter around each of the stations. Since the layer created in Open Street Maps was in EPSG:4326 WGS84 Geographic Projection, the CRS was converted to EPSG:32643 - WGS 84 UTM Zone 43N. I then used a raster layer showing the population in 2020. The resolution of the raster was 100m x 100m per pixel. The pixel value is the estimated number of people within the 100 sq.km area. Since I had a vector layer representing the whole city, I was able to find the total population and the population within the 1km catchment area of the stations.

This works well as an estimate but does not consider how people actually travel to the stations. Using the Open Route Service API, I was able to access road information to see what the actual 1km buffer zone around a station was. This gave a more realistic figure.
